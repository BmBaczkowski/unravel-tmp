# Info

This is the outcome of the reproducibility process of the results reported by [Kalbe and Schwabe (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0001075) regarding memory recognition test.

Three outcomes from the original paper were attempted to be reproduced for each study:
- overall memory performance (hit rate per encoding phase and false alarm rate)
- two-way repeated measures ANOVA on corrected recognition score
- paired t-tests as follow-up to ANOVA.
