# Info

One high threshold model of recognition judgment was fitted to behavioral data from 24-hour memory recognition test, utilizing bayesian sampling with MCMC implemented in STAN. 

## Bayesian graphical model

Bayesian cognitive model is depicted using graphical models (Lee & Wagenmakers, 2013). 
<a href='../docs-mdl/mdl_1HT.pdf' target='_blank'>View graphical model (pdf file).</a>

The graphical model represents the dependencies between observed data and latent parameters. It consists of nodes and directed edges, where nodes represent random variables (both observed and unobserved), and edges represent probabilistic / deterministic dependencies between these variables.
