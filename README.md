This is a research compendium for the project XYZ. 
The compendium is organised based on [BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.0/) standard, but not fully compatible due to custom workflows. 

The results are based on the original dataset sourced from OSF repository [Kalbe and Schwabe](https://osf.io/qpm3t/) shared under CC-BY license and reported in the paper by [Kalbe and Schwabe (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0001075).

## Prerequisites        

To successfully reproduce the analysis in this repository, ensure that you have the following tools installed:
1. **GNU Make:** This is used to automate the build process of the project.
2. **Docker/Podman**: Docker / Podman is used to create a containerized environment where the analysis runs in an isolated environment with all necessary dependencies. This approach also isolates the analysis from the host system.

The code was executed with `GNU Make 3.81` and `podman version 5.0.2` on `macOS Ventura 13.6.7 (22G720)` with an Apple M2 Pro chip. If you do not have `podman` installed, you can modify the `Makefile` to use the appropriate container engine (e.g., `docker`). Simply modify the variable `ENGINE` in the `Makefile`.

### Podman Machine Info

| Parameter      | Value                        |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| **OsArch** | linux/arm64: 5.0.3 | 
| **Kernel**     | 6.8.8-300.fc40.aarch64 |
| **CPUs**       | 8 |
| **Memory**     | 32 GB |
| **Disk Size**  | 100 GB |


## Getting Started

### Build the image

A `Dockerfile` is provided in the `dockerfiles` directory. To build the image, navigate to the `dockerfiles` directory and run:
```bash 
cd dockerfiles
make build-docker-r
```

This will create an image called `rstan:2.32.5` that contains all the dependencies needed to run the analysis.

To test the container, run:
```bash 
make test-docker-r
```

### Run the code with `GNU Make`

Once you have the Docker image built, you can use `GNU Make` to run the analysis inside the Docker container. `Make` will automate the process and ensure the proper environment is used.

#### Rebuild everything (not-recommended)

To run all the models: 
```bash 
make all
```

This may overkill your system. By default, small MCMC sampling is performed. 

#### Rebuild specific outcome folders (recommended)

Open master `Makefile` and decide what you want to rebuild. For example:
```bash 
# to download the source data from OSF repository
make download

# to fit 1HT bayesian model (requires data and other pre-requisits)
make 1HT
```
